# techlog-article-service

## Introduction
- This is the repository of the APIs that my TechLog blog will use in order to do the CRUD operations on the article data

## History
- Initially this project was planned to be implemented in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) backend
- However, due to my personal reasons, I am now required to learn and use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Hence this project from now on will be migrated from the previous TS codebase into Python codebase using FastAPI

## Roadmap
- Techstacks are the followings(to be added)
  - Backend Framework: FastAPI with [Python typing system](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), and with [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.9

  - Database: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) with [SQLAlchemy 2.0](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) and [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)

  - Python related tools
    - package managing tool: [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
    - code formatter: [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - linter: [ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/)
    - unit testing: [pytest](https://pytest.org/)

  - CI/CD tools
    - [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
    - test coverage tool
