##### Hi! I am a software engineer with working experience of around a year.

Currently I am seeking a junior Backend position, possibly using Node.js, Python, or Golang.
However, I am very open-minded about tech stacks, so any other languages & frameworks will be welcomed,
as long as I can participate in a wonderful project in a wonderful team!
